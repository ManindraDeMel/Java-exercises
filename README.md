# COMP1110 Labs

### Before You Start

It is essential that you use My Timetable to [enroll](https://www.anu.edu.au/students/program-administration/timetabling/student-access-and-support-for-mytimetable) in a lab class before the end of Week 1.

### The Labs Repository

This repository is the basis for COMP1110/COMP1140/COMP6710 lab exercises.
In the [week 1 lab](src/comp1110/lab1/), you will [**fork**](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html#creating-a-fork) your own copy of this repository, which you will use for the remainder of the semester.
